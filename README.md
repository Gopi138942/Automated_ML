# Automated_ML


## Project Overview

**Project Title**: AutoML System for Data Science Automation  
**Level**: Advanced  
**Technology**: Machine Learning, Python, Auto-sklearn, H2O.ai, Optuna, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, FastAPI

This project aims to build an **end-to-end AutoML system** that automates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. The goal is to replicate the tasks typically performed by a data scientist, automating the workflow to make machine learning more accessible and efficient.

## Objectives

1. **Automate Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess datasets automatically, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. **Model Selection**: Automatically select the best machine learning model for a given dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tune the chosen models using techniques like GridSearch, RandomSearch, or Optuna.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Automatically evaluate model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as an API for easy interaction and predictions.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Preprocessing Module**
- **Feature Engineering**: Automatically handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features.
- **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations like polynomial features or one-hot encoding to enhance model performance.

### 2. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Model Selection**: Use Auto-sklearn or H2O.ai to automatically select the most suitable machine learning model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use libraries like Optuna to perform hyperparameter optimization.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate the models on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
- Automatically choose the best model based on these metrics.

### 4. **Deployment**
- Deploy the trained model using **FastAPI** to create a REST API.
- **Streamlit** for building an interactive web app to interact with the model.

## Example Code

### **1. Data Preprocessing**

```python
from automl.preprocessing import preprocess_data

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
X, y = preprocess_data(df, target='target_column')
